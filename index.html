 <p>My name is Dane Jones and I am currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Psychology. Prior to the University of the West Indies, 
    I was a student at Ardenne High School. During sixth form, I realised my passion for computing but did not really delve far out of my comfort zone. I stuck to small 
    coding problems and easy to solve tasks. However, with web development I see a fascinating field with distinct problems that require just as unique solutions. I look 
    forward to expressing my creativity in new ways during and after this course. </p>
